## Installation

From source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ydcmd.git
cd ydcmd
sudo cp ydcmd.py /usr/local/bin/ydcmd
```

## How you can help

* Translate this document to your native language
* Fix errors in documentation
* Share information with your friends
* Submit PR if you are a developer

## Setup

To work with the client, you need to obtain an OAuth token. **Simple method** - use the built-in command:

```bash
python ydcmd.py token
```

The command will output a beautiful instruction and authorization link. Simply:

1. Follow the link in your browser
2. Grant access to the application
3. Copy the authorization code from the page
4. Paste it in the terminal and press Enter

The script will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Get OAuth token
- ‚úÖ Create or update configuration file `~/.ydcmd.cfg`
- ‚úÖ Save token in secure format

After that you can immediately use all ydcmd commands!

### Alternative method (registering your own application):

1. Register an application on Yandex
2. Set permissions: `Yandex.Disk REST API`
3. Enable `Development client`
4. Use the received `client_id` for authorization

```

**Options**:

* `--poll=<N>` - time in seconds between status polling when performing asynchronous operations;
* `--async` - execute command without waiting for completion (`poll`) operation.

In case of name collision, directories and files will be overwritten. Directories are copied recursively (including nested files and directories).

```
ydcmd cat <disk:/object>
```

### Creating directory

```
ydcmd mkdir <disk:/path>

### Closing access

```
ydcmd revoke <disk:/object>
```

### Estimating occupied space

```

* `--dry` - do not perform deletion, but output list of objects for deletion;
* `--type=<S>` - type of objects for deletion (`file` - files, `dir` - directories, `all` - all);
* `--keep=<S>` - criterion for selecting objects that need to be preserved:
  * To select date **before** which data needs to be deleted, you can use date string in ISO format (e.g., `2014-02-12T12:19:05+04:00`);
  * To select relative time, you can use number and dimension (e.g., `7d`, `4w`, `1m`, `1y`);
  * To select number of copies, you can use number without dimension (e.g., `31`).

If target object is not specified, root directory of storage will be used. Sorting and filtering of objects is performed by modification date (not creation date).

### Restoring file or directory from trash

```
ydcmd restore <trash:/object> [name]
```

**Options**:

* `--poll=<N>` - time in seconds between status polling when performing asynchronous operations;
* `--async` - execute command without waiting for completion (`poll`) operation.

In case of name collision, directories and files will be overwritten. Directories are restored recursively (including nested files and directories).

### Downloading file from internet to storage

```
ydcmd download <URL> [disk:/object]
```

**Options**:

* `--poll=<N>` - time in seconds between status polling when performing asynchronous operations;
* `--async` - execute command without waiting for completion (`poll`) operation;
* `--no-redirects` - prohibit redirects during download.

If target object is not specified, root directory of storage will be used, and file name will be chosen based on URL content (if possible).

### Getting OAuth token

```
ydcmd token [code]
```

Without specifying argument, command will output link for getting code. Open link in browser, grant access to application and use received code as argument to get OAuth token.

## Configuration

For convenience, it is recommended to create configuration file named `~/.ydcmd.cfg` and set permissions `0600` or `0400` on it. File format:

```ini
[ydcmd]
# comment
<option> = <value>
```

For example:

```ini
[ydcmd]
token   = your_oauth_token
verbose = yes
ca-file = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important settings:

- **`token`** - OAuth token (required for operation)
- **`ca-file`** - path to SSL certificates file (optional)
  - If not specified, application works without SSL certificate verification
  - On Windows may need to be left empty: `ca-file = `

## Environment variables

* `YDCMD_TOKEN` - oauth token, has priority over `--token` option;
* `SSL_CERT_FILE` - name of file with certificates of trusted certification centers, has priority over `ca-file` option.

## Exit codes

When working in automatic mode (via cron), it may be useful to get command execution result:

* `0` - successful completion;
* `1` - general application error;
* `4` - HTTP-4xx status code (client error);
* `5` - HTTP-5xx status code (server error).
